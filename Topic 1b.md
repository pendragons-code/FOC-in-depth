## Data and Bits
Data on a computer is stored as binary digits ("bits")
- A bit holds a value of 1 or 0 (usually it has a 5 volts of electricity to represent 1 bit and a pulse of 0 volts to represent a 0 bit)
- This can also be used in fibre optics, where the presence and absense of voltage is represented with light instead.
- 8 bits make a byte
